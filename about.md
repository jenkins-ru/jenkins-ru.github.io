R&D and Automation engineer with Hardware/Embedded background.
I live in [Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuch%C3%A2tel), 
originally I am from [St. Petersburg, Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg).
I am passionate about open-source and open-source communities.

My main open-source project is [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io).
I started using Hudson in 2008 and became an active contributor in 2012.
In the project I maintain Jenkins core, Remoting, WinSW and a number of plugins.
I also organize events like [Jenkins meetups](https:/jenkins.io/projects/jam/)
and [GSoC](https:/jenkins.io/projects/gsoc) in the community.

Nowadays I work for [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/) on making Jenkins cloud-native.
Before that I was e
working at companies like [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) 
and [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/) on 
embedded processor cores and test automation for them. 
There is probably some my VHDL code in devices you use every day.
I also have a PhD degree in hardware design and contribute to the LibreCores open-source project.

There is no CV on this site, 
but there is a not-so-up-to-date profile on LinkedIn.
