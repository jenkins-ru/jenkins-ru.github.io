I met Hudson in 2008.
As usual, I started from test automation.
After several years of administration and closed-source patches,
I started contributing to open-source and finally ended up in the core team.

Currently I maintain Jenkins Core, Remoting, and more than 20 plugins.
Yes, it keeps me busy.
