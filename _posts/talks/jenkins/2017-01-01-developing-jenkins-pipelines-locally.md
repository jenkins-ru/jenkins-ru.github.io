If you have ever tried developing Pipeline Libraries in Jenkins, 
you may have noticed how long it takes to deploy a new version to server to discover just another syntax error. 
I will show how to edit and test Pipeline libraries locally before committing to the repository 
(with Configuration-as-Code and Docker).
